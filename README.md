# Checklist app

## Team
Waltteri Grek, Joel Kailanto, Joona Heinonen

## Introduction
The idea of the app is a basic list app, in which the user can manage different categories for different tasks (groceries, to-do, cleaning etc.).  
The project was the team's first React Native project and it was done in three weeks, including project management, planning and version control.
